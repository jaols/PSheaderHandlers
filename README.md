## Introduction
This is a simple set of tools to add or update [headers for PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/help/examples-of-comment-based-help?view=powershell-7.3) files. You'll get a simple header including the parameters from the `param()` part of the PowerShell file(s).

## Why?
Because we are lazy and just want to jumpstart header editing.

## Usage overview
The included PowerShell scripts have of course full headers with examples, so just issue `Get-help .\filename` for help and `Get-help .\filename -Examples` for examples.

## Feedback
As usual I'm always open for suggestions.
